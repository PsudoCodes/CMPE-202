 The fulcrum of our team is communication: 
Every Monday we had specific meetings where every member of the team communicated their feedback and suggestion to improve our code. We found this practice extremely beneficial and we got a very fundamental understanding of the problems we were trying to solve.
This practice helped us to understand the importance of communication in our team. We decided that going ahead, in every meeting, we were going to we put a strong emphasis on communication.
